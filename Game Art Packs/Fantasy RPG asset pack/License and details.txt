FANTASY RPG (by Franuka) v1.6
-------------------------
Thank you for purchasing this asset pack!
It was created from scratch by me.
Feel free to use it on any commercial or non-commercial project (as long as you don't resell the assets), just remember to add a link to my itch page and/or Twitter, it helps a lot :) -->https://twitter.com/franuka_art

Included are all the tiles and spritesheets for each asset in two sizes (100% and 200%), in .png format, transparent background. You should be able to recreate anything you see on the example images.
The tiles are 16x16px (100%) or 32x32px (200%).
